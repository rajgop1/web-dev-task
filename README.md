# Tic-Tac-Toe Assignment

## Instructions for Apoorva

Apoorva, your task is to create a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

**Important:**  
ðŸš¨ **Do not open or check `index.html`, `script.js`, or `styles.css` files** as they contain the complete solution.  
ðŸš¨ You should write the code in a separate set of files and try to implement the game on your own.

   - The cells should be styled properly with a border.

2. **Game Logic**
   - The game should allow two players to play alternately as "X" and "O".
   - If a player clicks on an empty cell, their mark should appear.
   - The game should check for a winner after every move.
   - If all cells are filled and no one wins, it should display "It's a draw!".

3. **Winning Conditions**
   - The game should recognize winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals).
   - Once a player wins, display a message with the winner's name.
   - Prevent further moves once the game is won.

4. **Restart Functionality**
   - Add a button that resets the game when clicked.
   - Reset the board, clear all cells, and start with player "X".
